# Conversation Sample Application with Amazon Alexa

This Node.js app demonstrates the Conversation service in a simple chat interface simulating a cognitive car dashboard and Amazon Alexa integration.
Alexa is the voice service behind products, like the Amazon Echo.

That code is based two different projects designed by colleagues.
* [Conversation Simple Sample](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/conversation-simple)
* [Alexa Skill with Servless & Watson Conversation](https://github.com/IBM/alexa-skill-watson-conversation?cm_sp=Developer-_-create-an-alexa-skill-with-serverless-and-a-conversation-_-Get-the-Code) --- Credit goes to [Niklas Heidloff](http://heidloff.net/) for creating the original project.

## Configuration
That code requires Watson Conversation & Redis service (available on IBM Cloud), and the configuration of Amazon Alexa Skills.
